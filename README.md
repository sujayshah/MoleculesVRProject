# MoleculesVRProject
NCSA Project

This is a simple guide to using MoleculesVR. You will need a Google Daydream VR Headset in order to be able to run the project in full.
-However, this feature is not yet available as our team is still working on controls.

-To use in the Unity window, just ensure the following steps:

-Go to Asset > Assetbundles > Ensure that Simulation Mode is checked.
-Run the simulation

For now, the mouse is used to test the main menu. All the menu options will go to the sample scene we have created. Eventually, the options will go to a different scene with the selected molecule shown.

To add an AssetBundle item:
-Make sure that Simulation Mode is disabled, go to Asset > AssetBundles < Disable Simulation Mode.
add the .fbx or .obj file to the project and set its AssetBundle tag to 'molecules', which should already be an option.
-Turn on Simulation Mode again, and your menu should be changed.
